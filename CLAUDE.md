# CLAUDE.md — SDL_libretro

An SDL3-based [libretro](https://www.libretro.com/) frontend library. Spiritual successor to [raylib-libretro](https://github.com/RobLoach/raylib-libretro), redesigned with SDL3-idiomatic conventions. C99, zlib/libpng license.

## Architecture

### Context-based design

All state lives in an opaque `SDL_Libretro*` context, unlike raylib-libretro's global static. Internally split into:
- `struct SDL_Libretro` — persistent settings (directories, volume, speed, keyboard map, OSD, renderer/window)
- `SDL_LibretroCoreData` — per-core state, zeroed on unload (symbols, texture, audio, options)

Since libretro C callbacks have no userdata parameter, a file-static `SDL_Libretro_active` pointer is set when a core loads. **Only one active context per process.**

### Header-only library

Consumers define `SDL_LIBRETRO_IMPLEMENTATION` in **exactly one** translation unit before `#include "SDL_libretro.h"`; everything else includes it normally (the example is that one TU). **Linkage split:** the public `SDL_Libretro_*` API has **external** linkage so it's callable from any TU, while internal helpers and cross-file functions are `static`. `include/SDL_libretro.h` is the umbrella: public declarations on top, then an `#ifdef SDL_LIBRETRO_IMPLEMENTATION` region holding the private structs/`#define`s, the `static SDL_Libretro_active` global, internal (`static`) forward declarations, and `#include`s of each `include/*.h` implementation fragment (lifecycle last). There is no compiled library — the CMake `SDL_libretro` target is `INTERFACE` (include paths + SDL3 link only).

### File layout

- `include/SDL_libretro.h` — umbrella: public API + private types + implementation fan-out
- `include/SDL_libretro_core.h` — lifecycle (create, destroy, load core/game)
- `include/SDL_libretro_video.h` — texture creation, pixel format conversion, video refresh callback
- `include/SDL_libretro_audio.h` — SDL_AudioStream push model, dynamic rate control, sample callbacks
- `include/SDL_libretro_input.h` — gamepad/keyboard/mouse polling, RETROK→SDL_Scancode table
- `include/SDL_libretro_env.h` — environment callback dispatch (the big switch)
- `include/SDL_libretro_options.h` — core variables/options (dynamic arrays, not fixed-size)
- `include/SDL_libretro_serialize.h` — save state, SRAM, cheats
- `include/SDL_libretro_config.h` — INI-backed config persistence (built on vendored `SDL_ini.h`)
- `include/SDL_libretro_messages.h` — OSD message queue (priority, duration, progress)
- `include/SDL_libretro_vfs.h` — SDL3-backed VFS bridge for `RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_GET_VFS_INTERFACE`

Each `include/*.h` fragment is guarded by `#if defined(SDL_LIBRETRO_IMPLEMENTATION) && !defined(<FILE>_IMPL_ONCE)` and is meant to be pulled in only by the umbrella header.

**Adding a function:** a *public* one is declared non-`static` in the umbrella's public section and defined non-`static` in a fragment; an *internal* one is forward-declared `static` in the umbrella's implementation region and defined `static` in a fragment (declaration and definition linkage must match). Fragment-local helpers are plain `static` with no umbrella declaration. A new subsystem fragment must be added to the umbrella's `#include` fan-out (before `SDL_libretro_env.h` if the env switch references it).

### Core loading

Uses `SDL_LoadObject()` / `SDL_LoadFunction()` instead of libretro-common's `dylib.h`. Resolves all 25+ libretro symbols on load.

### Pixel formats

- `RETRO_PIXEL_FORMAT_RGB565` → `SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGB565` (direct)
- `RETRO_PIXEL_FORMAT_XRGB8888` → `SDL_PIXELFORMAT_XRGB8888` (direct — no conversion needed, unlike raylib)
- `RETRO_PIXEL_FORMAT_0RGB1555` → `SDL_PIXELFORMAT_XRGB1555` (direct)

### Audio

Push model via `SDL_PutAudioStreamData()` — the device stream is opened with a NULL callback so samples are queued directly from the main thread during `retro_run()`. No cross-thread sharing or atomics needed. int16→float conversion at queue time. Back-pressure drops batches when the queued byte count exceeds `audioQueueThresholdBytes`, derived from the audio latency (`minimumAudioLatencyMs`, default 100 ms; settable at runtime via `SDL_Libretro_SetAudioLatency`) and floored to a few sample batches so a tiny latency can't starve the queue.

**Dynamic rate control (DRC):** each frame `SDL_Libretro_UpdateDRC` sets the stream's frequency ratio to `speed × drcAdjustment`. `speed` makes fast-forward/slow-mo track pitch and consumption; `drcAdjustment` is a proportional ±0.5 % nudge (normal speed only) that holds the queue near 50 % fill so it never drifts to empty (underrun) or full (drops). A runtime sample-rate change (`SET_SYSTEM_AV_INFO`) reopens the stream, since the stream frequency is fixed at open time.

## Build

```sh
git submodule update --init
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build .
```

SDL3 is fetched via FetchContent if not system-installed. Only `libretro.h` is needed from the libretro-common submodule.

## Coding conventions

- **Language:** C99
- **Public API:** `SDL_Libretro_*` prefix, `bool` returns with `SDL_SetError()`.
- **Memory:** `SDL_malloc` / `SDL_free` / `SDL_calloc` / `SDL_realloc`.
- **Strings:** `SDL_strlcpy`, `SDL_strcmp`, `SDL_snprintf`.
- **Logging:** `SDL_Log*` family.

## Dependencies

- **SDL3** (required) — video, audio, input, threads, atomics, file I/O, dynamic loading
- **libretro.h** (required) — API header from libretro-common submodule
